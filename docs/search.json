    "text": "How AI “Learns”\n\nA dataset of 60,000 mushrooms was used, with each mushroom labeled as edible or poisonous.\nFeatures like cap shape, stem color, and bruising were recorded. For example, some mushrooms have smooth caps, while others are convex or flat.\nData was cleaned and converted into a format the AI could process. For instance, “red” became a numeric value like 1."

    "text": "The AI Models Used\n\nLogistic Regression: Think of this as a quick, educated guess based on patterns. While fast, it wasn’t as accurate as other models.\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): This model compared each mushroom to similar ones it had seen before. It was more accurate but slower with large datasets.\nSupport Vector Classifier (SVC): This advanced model identified the best boundary between edible and poisonous mushrooms. It was the most accurate but required more setup time.\n\nBy analyzing these features, AI helps foragers like yourself make informed decisions about mushroom safety."
